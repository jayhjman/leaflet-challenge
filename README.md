# Earthquake Intensity Mappings

- **_USGS Earthquake Mapping_** - Is based off USGS Earthquake Hazards Program data from the [USGS GeoJson](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) summary page for the category of significant earthquakes for the past 7 days. The goal in the visualizations is to map not only the magnitude of the earthquakes but also the depth. The images provided outline a simple map which shows the earthquake mapping and a secondary map with controls to change the map layers and optionally remove/add both earthquake or tectonic plate information. The rendering of the map, legends, and controls were accomplished through the usage of a javascript library called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and as a map layer [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) APIs were used to render the various maps.
